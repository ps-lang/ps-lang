<@. ABSTRACT - COLLABORATIVE WORKSPACE @.>
Multi-agent AI systems face significant challenges in managing context flow between agents, leading to **token inefficiency**, **privacy concerns**, and **computational waste**.

<.rlhf feedback="positive" count="234" context="users found this intro clear and compelling".rlhf>

We introduce **PS-LANG** (Privacy-First Script Language), a domain-specific language that employs zone-based syntax for precise context control in agent pipelines.

<!-- User Feedback: 89% of readers highlighted "zone-based syntax" as key innovation -->

Our approach enables developers to mark content as private, pass-through, or active workspace, ensuring that each agent receives only relevant information.

**Key Results:** <.rlhf highly-engaged="true".rlhf>
- **60% reduction** in token usage
- **95% context accuracy**
- **Full backwards compatibility** with Claude, GPT, Cursor, and Copilot

**Keywords:** Multi-agent systems · Context control · Privacy-preserving AI · Domain-specific languages · Token optimization · AI workflow management
