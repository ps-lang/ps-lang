# ps-lang - pseudocode lang.

<. take control of what you say or don't say > 

what is ps-lang

how do you install it

purpose:

create shorthand commands for agntic privacy and control via ai meta tags for further analysis and human feedback loops.

usecases: ai agents, chatbots, email mpc, ecommerce pipelines


how to use:
start with opening <
write a period . for general notes to self
or type a shorthand key or command that sets ai meta tags on your context window and automation needs
. end with a period

close with > or /> <#. for mulitiline support and nesting >

thats it.

make your own, use trending/popular commands, fully customizable, fueled by human and social feedback loops.

future integrations
mcp
cli
chatgpt connector
custom ai pipelines and workflows
context aware modals via ai meta tags


when choosing characters for shorthand, alsways start with the <. command and then think of custom ones until intuative character click with you or emoji replaces the command based on userfeedback 


some key examples for prompt engineering:

</. private dev note only for human devs to read >
<#. private note your okay agents to read >
<.. . >
<.. . >
<.. . >


example: </. something you want ai meta tags created on (privacy first) but dont want other agents to see >

</. means internal comments only for me only, no agents can see it except a human, in this case the admin or dev, should be blured out from any ai processing (app or ai model/agent). >


<#. is a comment for humans and coding agents primarily, other agents can view it but not contribute to code, only view code, not write it. >

Todos: 

Create strict privacy policy and human first terms of use for the app.

</. open source the codebase on github for people to commit (via approval) or clone or fork with proper sharing license but not to hurt the brand or use this for maliscous evil reasons.... >
